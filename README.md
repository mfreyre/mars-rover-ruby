## Challenge

You are on a team programming the remotely controlled Mars Rover robot. 
Given an initial starting point (x,y) and a list of commands, you want to be able to calculate what the end point (x’, y’) will be. 
The robot can turn forward and backward as well as left and right. 
Please develop a program that will calculate the final location of the rover after it has executed a list of commands.
